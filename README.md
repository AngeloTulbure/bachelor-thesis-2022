**Supervisor**     &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp; prof. Paolo Ciaccia <br>

This repo holds my thesis for my Bachelor's Degree in _Computer Engineering_ at the Universit√† di Bologna, in 2022. <br>

It focuses implementing a plugin for a generic CAD that allows the creation and the insert of new objects inside the CAD, starting from an XML file fomatted in the right way, deserialize its content, then resealize

it and create a DLL ready to use inside the CAD. The GUI for the plugin was implemented as well for a better user experience.
